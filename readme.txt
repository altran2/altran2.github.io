Note: I made this portfolio site as a side project 2 years ago and am using it as a submission for this assignment. However, I self taught myself front end web development then and didn't really know too much about validation checks. When working on this assignment, there were small changes that I had to do to make my site more universally accessible like adding alt descriptions for images or changing b tags to em/strong. Other changes I made were more content based to better depict who I am as an individual and my goals.

HTML: 
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external page(s)
- Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them
- Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer
- Adding custom icons from Google Material Icons or Font Awesome

CSS:
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab
- Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner
- Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks)

ADVANCED FEATURE:
- A contact form which leverages HTML forms

HOW LONG DID IT TAKE:
- It took me around 5 hours to complete this assignment as I was using my own old portfolio site and was mainly changing things to pass validator checks.
